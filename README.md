## Joe's Grade Checker
Parses grades from a Pearson ParentConnect website into a easily readable format and can output to multiple sources   

### Todo List and Problems
- All requests are made with a custom UserAgent
- Implement a logging system and add a quiet option (no console output)
- Fix retreiving grades with multiple students on one profile
    - Find a way for the program to automatically select a student given a name
    - Produce output for more than one student (maybe?)
